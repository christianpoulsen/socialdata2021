    "1. Take the data for the period of 2010-2018 and group by precinct (see Week 2)\n",
    "2. As we are interested in comparing the **fraction** of each crimes across precincts, we will to normalize the data once again:\n",
    "  * As above, to normalize the data you need to divide number of specific crime in a district by the *total number of crimes in the district*. Thus, to give a concrete example you should devide the number of assaults in Bayview by the total number of crimes in Bayview and so on \n",

    "# see one of the guides or Google\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. For this visualisation, we are going to work with **vbar_stack**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p.vbar_stack(stackers=..., x=..., source=src, ...) ### you need to find what a stacker is\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. (Optional) You can see that my hover effect also shows the numbers. Use [this example](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/16e87ed63ca1aecaa42e93293f32d936685dcd3e/sphinx/source/docs/user_guide/examples/categorical_bar_stacked_hover.py) to implement a more informative hover.
