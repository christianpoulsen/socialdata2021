    "**Topic 2: Setting up a webpage**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the deliverables for the final project is to create a webpage with your visualizations. There are many ways of doing that. This year - as we are always striving to make the course better, we're making web-page creation part of the course (until now, I thought that was something everyone just knew how to do), so that's what we'll focus on in the second half of today's lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data prep\n",
    "\n",
    "A key step is to set up the data right. So for this one, we'll be pretty strict about the steps. The workflow is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the data for the period of 2010-2018 and group it by hour-of-the-day (see Week 2)\n",
    "2. We would like to be able to easily compare how the distribution of crimes differ from each other, not absolute numbers, the focus here will be *normalized data*:\n",
    "  * To normalise data for within a crime category you simply to devide the count for each hour by the total number of this crime type. (To give a concrete example in the `ASSAULT` category, take the number of assault-counts in 1st hour you should devide by the total number ofassaults, then you devide number of assaults in 2nd hour by the total number of assaults and so on)\n",
    "  *  It will be easiest if you organize your dataframe as shown in [this helpful screenshot](https://github.com/suneman/socialdataanalysis2020/blob/master/files/week8_1_data.PNG?raw=true).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've followed these steps, your data should be ready! Take a moment to celebrate. We now follow the [Bokeh guide for categorical data](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/categorical.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, let's convert our **Pandas Dataframe** to **Bokeh ColumnDataSource**: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "source = ColumnDataSource(your_processed_dataframe)\n",
    "## it is a standard way to convert your df to bokeh\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. We also need to create an empty figure (we will add our stuff here later on). Mini sub-exercise: Find the a guide how to define a figure in Bokeh online. Here is a little help:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p = figure(...., x_range = FactorRange(factors=hours), ...) #p is a standard way to call figures in Bokeh\n",
    "#make sure to add x_range. In my case hours is a list on the form ['1', '2', '3' ... , '24']\n",
    "#read up on the FactorRange in the guide\n",
    "#do not forget to add other attributes to the figure, e.g. title, axis names and so on\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Now we are going to add the bars. In order to do so, we will use **vbar** (see the guide for help):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bar ={} # to store vbars\n",
    "### here we will do a for loop:\n",
    "for indx,i in enumerate(focuscrimes):\n",
    "    bar[i] = p.vbar(x='name_of_the_column_that_contain_hours',  top=i, source= src, \n",
    "                    ### we will create a vbar for each focuscrime\n",
    "                    legend_label=i,  muted_alpha=..., muted = ....) \n",
    "#i stands for a column that we use, top=y; we are specifying that our numbers comes from column i\n",
    "#read up what legend_label, muted and muted_alpha do... you can add more attributes (you HAVE TO)\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The last thing to do is to make your legend interactive and display the figure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p.legend.click_policy=\"mute\" ### assigns the click policy (you can try to use ''hide'\n",
    "show(p) #displays your plot\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. You will notice that the legend appears in the middle of the figure (and it ocludes some of the data). In order to fix this look into [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26254619/position-of-the-legend-in-a-bokeh-plot) as a start. Below are some code snippets that you can use to deal with this problem (but read the guide first):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = [] ### for the custom legend // you need to figure out where to add it\n",
    "items.append((i, [bar[i]])) ### figure where to add it\n",
    "legend = Legend(items=..., location=.....) ## figure where to add it\n",
    "p.add_layout(...., ...) ## figure where to add it\n",
    "### if you read the guide, it will make sense\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to recreate this amazing visualisation :) Thanks to **Germans** for help creating this exercise.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Preamble: A quick intro to Git\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an essential tool for anyone who works with data or code. It makes it easy to keep various versions of your code, and to collaborate on code with other people ny hosting code on, for example, [github](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will also rely on github for hosting our website, it's a good idea to go through a brief introduction to git and github in case you're not familiar with them: [this tutorial should provide a good first exposure.](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hugo\n",
    "[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a framework for quickly creating beautiful websites using nothing more than the Markdown you are used to from Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further, make a new directory, navigate to it in a terminal (for whose of you using windows, you should ~~stop using windows~~ use [git-bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)), and turn it into a git repository by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within that directory, go through Hugo's quick-start tutorial [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Pick a nice theme, and play around with your website (add some text, try some of the formatting options, etc.).\n",

    "[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers an easy way to host your static websites directly on github. We'll do  that with the basic website we just created. You can find some information on how to do this [here](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/tutorials/github-pages-blog/): we'll detail the first alternative from that tutorial, but if you're comfortable with git, we suggest trying the second alternative as it is more flexible.\n",

On the next page, follow the instructions under \"…or push an existing repository from the command line\", and push the repository containing your Hugo website.

    "#### Adding some visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "You now (should) have a website, but it's kind of empty. Let's populate it with a few different visualizations from previous weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simple matplotlib figures*: Matplotlib is easy, as it just exports plain images that you can include in your website. Choose a nice visualization form one of the previous weeks, save it to a file (hint: look into `pyplot.savefig`), and add it to a page on your website (see [here](https://www.austinfriday.com/tutorial/adding-images-to-your-hugo-pages/) for a simple walkthrough).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** because we are taking the easy road and building our website in the docs folder, you'll probably have an issue when viewing the images once your site is online. See [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/can-i-reference-baseurl-from-content/2686/2) for a fix:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a file  `your_website_folder/layouts/shortcodes/baseurl.html` (you might have to create the `shortcodes` folder)\n",
    "* Put the following line in that file: `{{ .Page.Site.BaseURL }}`\n",
    "* You can then reference images in your markdown file as follows: `![image description]({{< baseurl >}}/image.png)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you can see my (very elaborate) page for an example of how it should look [here](https://ldorigo.github.io/dataviz_website_demo/pages/matplotlib/).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bokeh Plots*: Now that we know how to put static images, let's notch it up a little bit and add those fantastic interactive plots from the previous exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, see [here](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html) for how to export bokeh plots as html. \n",
    "If you open the resulting html file in a text editor, you should see there's two parts: a `<head> ... </head>`, where the bokeh library is loaded, and a `<body> ... </body>`, where the plots are rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to include those plots into a new hugo page is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a blank markdown page\n",
    "* At the beginning of the page, copy-paste the two `<script>`s that are in the `<head>` of your html file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-2.3.0.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-HjagQp6T0/7bxYTAXbLotF1MLAGWmhkY5siA1Gc/pcEgvgRPtMsRn0gQtMwGKiw1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n",

    "```    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Where you want your plots to appear, copy-pase everything that's inside the `<body>` of your html file\n",
    "* To allow rendering html, you need to add the following two lines to your hugo configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[markup.goldmark.renderer]\n",
    "    unsafe = true\n",
    "```    \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to see your bokeh plot on your page. If you want to add more plots in the same page, you can repeat the above, but you **don't** need to add what's in the `<head>` again (that is, the `<script>`s in the `<head>` should only be on your page once).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Note:** _Just pasting all the html on top level isn't exactly coding best practice, but it's easy and it'll do for a small project like this. If you can stomach it, there are better ways, such as the one desribed [here](https://angelov.ai/post/2020/05/interactive-plots-with-bokeh/)._\n",

    "#### Closing Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats, you can now make a website! We've only scratched the surface, but this should be enough to get started on your projects.
